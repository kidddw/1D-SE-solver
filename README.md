# 1D-SE-solver
1D Schrodinger Equation Solver:
Solves the one-dimensional time-independent Schrodinger equation for one electron and a supplied potential. Representation spaces include the real-space grid, finite difference approach and the Gaussian basis, each provided as classes. Outputs energy eigenvalues and prints solutions for first few eigenstates (corresponding to the ground and first few excited states).
